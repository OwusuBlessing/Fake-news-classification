    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "The prevalence of fake news on online media platforms is increasingly recognized as a critical concern for society, as it has the potential to manipulate public opinion, incite social unrest, and erode trust in credible news sources. To mitigate the negative impact of fake news, the development of an effective classification system capable of accurately identifying and filtering false news articles from genuine sources is essential. However, building such a system presents numerous challenges, including the multifaceted and intricate nature of news content, the rapid dissemination of fake news through social media channels, and the possibility of biased or incomplete datasets. As such, it is imperative to develop an accurate and reliable fake news classification system leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By achieving this, we can safeguard the integrity of news and promote public trust in media outlets.\n"
